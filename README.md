# AWS AI/ML Project: Landmark-Classification-Tagging-for-Social-Media-Project

## Project Title: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

### Project Description:
In this project, I focused on:

- Building a CNN to classify landmarks through:
  - visualizing the dataset
  - processing the dataset
  - building the CNN
  - exporting of the network using Torch Script
  
- Used transfer learning to create a CNN to classify landmarks through:
  - deciiding between a varietty of pre-trained models built for classification
  - traning the pre-built model
  - testing the transfer-learned network
  - exporting of the network using Torch Script

- Both building and transfer learning tasks were completed in Jupyter Notebooks, and then was deployed as an app.
